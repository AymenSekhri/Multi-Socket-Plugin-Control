# Multi-Socket-Plugin-Control
An old project i made back in 2014, it is mutli-socket server and client with the ability to communicate through plugins or libraries (DLL).<br/>
There are few bugs, i'm too lazy to fix it now.<br/>
The project is for educational propuses only. I don't allow any use in blackhat/illegal activeties.<br/>
